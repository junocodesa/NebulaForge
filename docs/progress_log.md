# Progress Log

- 2022-07-05: Recorded the Luminous Atlas mission and linked the README to the new manifest.
- 2022-07-10: Added next-action cues so generated narratives came with explicit after-work nudges.
- 2022-07-17: Layered in motivation, keeping the story tethered to why the idea matters.
- 2022-07-25: Built the action-plan mode so every run doubles as a tiny sprint review entry.
- 2022-08-01: Documented how to run the CLI and what `--detail` should feel like in practice.
- 2022-08-16: Captured a journal template that helps me follow up after each commit.
- 2022-08-24: Tidy up the `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean from the usual side files.
- 2022-09-02: Added a little helper script so the ritual of generating ideas stays frictionless.
