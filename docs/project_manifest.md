# Luminous Atlas Manifest

Luminous Atlas is the working name for the personal project lab I am building inside NebulaForge. The mission is to capture the scattered, messy energy of hacking on solo ideas after work hours: take one concrete spark, overdeliver by a tiny margin, then lock it in with a believable commit.

The repo should read like a real engineer's journal, so every change is framed as a follow-up to the previous mini-sprint. Each idea inherits a stack, a narrative reason to exist, and a single next action. That way the history reads as living proof that the project has been steadily evolving.

I plan to keep the idea generator light, but the supporting docs and command-line UI should feel polished enough to share with a curious friend.
