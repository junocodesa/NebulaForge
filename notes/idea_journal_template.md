# Idea Journal Template

1. **Idea snapshot**: paste the name and story from `nebulaforge/idea_generator.py --detail` here so the everyday narrative is preserved.
2. **Stack highlights**: note the first stack item, why it matters, and what supporting libraries are already in place.
3. **Next action**: copy the generated line straight into your to-do list so it feels like a real scrap of planning.
4. **Mini retrospective**: after the next commit, jot down what worked and what failed. This keeps the history human.
